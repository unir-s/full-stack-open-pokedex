  For an application written in Rust, we use rustfmt (and clippy) for linting, cargo test for testing, and cargo build for building. The Rust community make a decision like Go or Prettier that builds up a unified develop tools ecosystem to avoid potential debates about code style, tool selection and other messy things. Then every rustaceans could suffer less from configuration hell.
  Besides Jenkins and Github Actions, CI tools include buddy, TeamCity, wercker, bamboo, and so on. TeamCity from JetBrains has build grid which allows running multiple builds and tests under different environments simultaneously. Bamboo has built-in disaster recovery which gives team build resilence and hight availability. Bamboo also guarantees confidence in scaling. Bamboo is good at integrating with other develop tools, including Jira for a seamless experience, AWS CodeDeploy for CD, and Opsgenie for quick incident investigation.
  I guest the team should select a cloud-based environment. Since the team has only 6 people, it's obviously not a large project. In this situation, a cloud-based environment generally has better price and needs less effort on configuration. However,  I don't know whether their application needs some specific hardware, so there is possibility that they still prefer to a self-hosted solution for funcionality.
